## This Project is Archived

Node and React are unkind to long-lived projects. Libraries and trends are constantly changing. Dependencies will be abandoned.

If you're using this project or interested in it, I recommend forking it, gutting the features you don't want or need, and then incrementally rewriting the bits that are left. Or perhaps start fresh, and borrow the parts of this you like. 

Most of this codebase is from the 2016-2020 era of JavaScript. To modernize it without breaking things would be a huge time commitment, and I no longer have that time.

**As of version 7, semver is no longer followed**. Going forward patch updates may require major Node.js version updates, or contain removal of functionality.
